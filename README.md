Chrome User Stylesheet
======================

Chrome 32 discontinued support for user stylesheets. That is absurd and offensive to anyone who requires special needs.

It used to be accessed here (on Mac OSX):
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User\ Stylesheets/Custom.css`

This extension allows you to recreate that support by using a new `Custom.css` file (included).


Installation
------------

1. Download to your computer.
2. Move the folder to a place on your computer where it will stay.
2. Open chrome://extensions/ in Google Chrome.
3. Check *Developer Mode* at the top right.
4. Click *Load unpacked extension...* and browse to the folder you downloaded.
5. Select that folder.
6. Enjoy!

Future development
------------------

I need to find a way to pack this extension but still allow the CSS to be edited by the user. This will simply installation.
